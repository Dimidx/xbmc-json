The HTTP API of Xbox Media Center will be depreciated in upcoming releases, the replacement API will be based on JSON. A substantial amount of work has already been completed on the new API and a lot of the functions are considered complete so it's time to start writing a library to interface with it.

You will need to be running a recent nightly build of XBMC in order to use the JSON API as it was not included in the last stable release.

### Project using this library - XBMC Remote Control: ###
